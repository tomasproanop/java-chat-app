# Java Chat App

Thia Java Chat App based on socket TCP/IP is a demo messaging application that allows multiple users to communicate in real-time over a network. It utilizes the socket programming model to establish a reliable connection between clients and a server, enabling seamless exchange of text-based messages. 

This app utilizes Java's robust networking capabilities, which I wanted to further explore by doing this project.
